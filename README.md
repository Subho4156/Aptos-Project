# 🍱 Transparent Food Donation Chain

## 📄 Project Description

The **Transparent Food Donation Chain** is a Move-based smart contract deployed on the Aptos blockchain. It provides a simple yet effective mechanism to track food donations transparently using Aptos tokens. The contract allows organizations to initialize a donation tracker and enables donors to contribute funds directly, ensuring all donations are publicly recorded and verifiable on-chain.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to create a trustworthy and transparent system for charitable food donations by leveraging blockchain technology. With growing concerns around mismanagement and lack of accountability in traditional donation channels, this project ensures:

- Transparency in every transaction
- Publicly accessible donation records
- Direct support from donors to verified food organizations
- Reduction of intermediaries and fraud

## 🚀 Future Scope

While the current version is minimal and focuses on tracking total donations, the project has strong potential for future development:

- ✅ Donor leaderboard to highlight top contributors
- ✅ Detailed donation history per user
- ✅ Integration with real-world NGOs and food banks
- ✅ Milestone-based fund release for verified usage
- ✅ Web front-end dashboard for user interaction
- ✅ NFT-based donor badges or rewards
- ✅ Multi-token donation support
